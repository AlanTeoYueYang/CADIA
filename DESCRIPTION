Description: The package is designed for interpreting genomic data by leveraging
             genetic interactions. Typical inputs of this program are two lists
             of genes, one contains a target list from an experiment and the 
             other contains all the genes in the experimental array. The output
             of the program is list of pathways and their respective p-values.
             In the current version, the pathways are retrieved from KEGG.

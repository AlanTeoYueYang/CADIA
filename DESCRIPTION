Description: The package is designed for interpreting high-throughput experimental 
             data by leveraging gene interactions. Typical inputs of this program 
             are two lists of genes, one contains a target list from an 
             experiment and the other contains all the genes in the experimental
             array. The output of the program is list of pathways and their 
             respective p-values. In the current version, the pathways are
             retrieved from KEGG. If you wish to use this package in your

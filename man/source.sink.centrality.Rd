\usage{
source.sink.centrality(adj.matrix, alpha, beta)
}
\arguments{
\item{adj.matrix}{the adjacency matrix of a graph to be analyzed}

\item{alpha}{is the decay factor, similar to the one in Katz centrality}

\item{beta}{is the relative effect of the sinks vs sources.}
}
\value{
A matrix in which the row i hold the vector of influence of the
node i on all the other nodes.
